Moreover, the MRP given over the box is also scratched (scratch mark is evidently seen over the box). Flipkart has to ensure to protect their image and that the customers are not cheated like this.

It gives a brownish goldenish tint color . Don't‚Äã apply on the roots i strongly recommend. You will get a similar color to the girl in the picture if u use 2 boxes and kept longer as it has a little hydrogen peroxide which has bleaching property and the Color will be quite permanent.~1300043.0

The best things about this is the quick absorb feature, which makes application super quick(5-8 minutes). Also, this hair color does not contain Ammonia, which makes prolonged use safe and easy on the hair.The color stays for about 15-20 days, about double the time their old hair color used to stay.The only con of this product is its high price. The effectiveness of the product may be able to justify the high cost, but I still consider it to be on the pricier side. Hence reducing a star.Hope this helped.~1300042.0

Colour is most vivid under incandescents and brighter LEDs; does not show up much under very diffuse lighting, especially CFLs. (For reference, my hair is a very dark brown, not pure black.)Altogether very satisfied with this product; wish it came in colours such as red, orange or purple!(Editing this review after several uses to add: in 5 out of 6 cases, the pump on the bottle has stopped working while there was still liquid in the bottle. This is a waste and a tragedy. I'd rather buy expensive imported colours than buy Indian and have to waste more than half the bottle every time.)~1300051.0

And does last long if kept dry....It does leave your hair looking dry and frizzy but it looks really good....Effects somewhat similar to semi-permanent hair dye on unbleached hair.... Only the hair might appear a bit clumpy if not sprayed evenly and not brushed thoroughly...The color is a dark blue(somewhere between a dark ultramarine and indigo)The only problem I have with the product is it's size.... A seen in the photo, it is really really small, and therefore doesn't last long at all...~1300051.0

Sprayed it on as per instructions. Yes, it has a metallic finish to it, definitely doesn't look like normally colored hair, but i didn't mind that. What i had a problem what that i wore a White top that day, and now the back of my top is completely green. Made me so conscious and I haven't had the guts to use it again. Every time i ran my fingers through my hair, my hands got the metallic green. Not sure if its worth the effort.I have also purchased the Blue spray and Im not sure if I want to use it now.~1300051.0

The colour pay off is good. The staying power is about more than a month. But the only problem with this is that it makes the hair pretty dry. I guess that is the problem with every hair colour product and can be minimised with regular care. Another shortcoming of the product which i came across after using the brown variant is that ""the product needs a good toner to build up the desired colour"". Yes you heard me right. If you do not use a toner then you will end up with a bronzy orangish highlight. Not the perfect brown highlight you were hoping for. But if you can take care of that then the product is a bomb for its price. Again there are people who might just like the bronzy finish in that case you are good to go. I have not used the blonde one so cammot really comment on it."~1300051.0

First of all let me tell you that  developer is semi cream but dye it self is LIQUID. Today even cheapest hair color comes in form of tubes/creams but revlon still is in 80's using old liquid dye system. Secondly Before applying i did allergy test (as c always do before using new product). Now its been 5 days since i used the product, i have itching all over my head, eye lashes and ears have swollen .So please think 2 times before buying it.

The pack does mention it : For short hair.... but its not mentioned here. I couldn't apply properly & have full coverage with this pack.After application, the color didn't seem to enhance up (I've blackish-brown color hair)... The color was very light...After about 1 week or so, i did seem to have a bit of hair-fall problem [Which is evident when you torture your hair :P]..

The price range seemed great. And although I knew it wouldnt be a very bright blue, I assumed it would at least have a tint of blue in the sunlight and I was okay with that.During the application process, the product colour was a deep blue, Beautiful. While applying it on, the gloves turned great, exciting. Even the edges of my forehead had a slight blue tint. However after keeping it on and washing ( Even the washed away water had a blue tint ), my haid was jet black.I assumed I would be able to see at least a tint in different lights over the days. However, the final result was just the same. Jet black hair. Quiet disappointing.~1300001.0

I see a lot of negative reviews here,  and I can only assume that they are a bunch of lies,  or these people don't know how to correctly read and follow the instructions on how to use the product,  or already have supremely damaged hair.I colour my hair quite often because I like a change up and a fresh look every 6 months at least. But I also deep condition my hair with oil twice a month and use a great shampoo.I was exuberantly surprised by this product because it surpassed my expectations. Exceedingly. No kidding. The reviews made me apprehensive,  but I decided to take a chance anyway.Before trying out the Wine,  Deep Burgundy,  my hair was a Dark Chocolate Brown with honey gold highlights. This colour made my hair look AMAZING!  The brown base turned into a deep luscious wine,  and the honey highlights turned into a deep crimson. It's like having gotten a pro colouring job in a DIY.This was no scalp irritation and it's ammonia free.  The smell is quite pleasant and the Shine Serum LEGIT  works. My hair was quite literally SHINING .I wash my hair almost everyday because I workout and so my head needs cleansing,  and the colour hasn't disappeared in over 3 weeks. And this is a red hue. So this is bloody fantastic!This is NOT  a sponsored review,  but I will be delighted if they gave me an offer or something on their hair colour, because I am going to be making a lot of future purchases.Update : I tried in The Honey Brown which basically went on as a Toffee colour and omg I LOOOOOOOOVE IT! SLAYING!These guys legit need to give me some special discount on this because I need a lifetime supply.~1300001.0

ND I'm quite satisfied with the results. A quick tip is to keep the hair color for at least 45-60 minutes if you do want the color to show on your hair. Secondly, try to wait atleast 1-2 days before washing off your hair with a shampoo. Also be patient for at least 2- 4 washes for the color to show on the hair. It does what it claims on the packaging plus the pricing is an added bonus.A quick trick is to use mustard oil on the colored hair after 24hrs of its drying and keeping it a fortnight. And then washing it off the next day. It did help me to deepen the hair colour.~1300001.0

However, the retail price of Rs 199 is superb too.Performance wise, it compares to Loreal. Nice colour to the hair when seen in sunlight. But nothing drastic, which i like.I have a few grey hair near my forehead which need to be coloured and it perfectly did the job.No smell of ammonia and the packaging is very nice.The serum which comes in a small tube and is added to the colour mixture protects the hair and gives shine to the hair. It hasn't so far, appeared to have damaged my hair in any way.I have now become a loyal user of this brand and use this for touch-ups regularly.I find that the red tones, especially Reddish brown and Deep burgundy are much more effective as hair colours rather than the brown range (which just might be my experience).~1300001.0

She is head over heels in love with this since it creates absolutely no mess and easily covers greys. It might take a while to get used to but it looks completely natural. Also it doesn't make hair crunchy or rough like normal hair sprays. I would recommend dark brown color more since it looks much more natural. For the price I think its a win win. It also lasts for days and will go off when ever you shampoo your hair. So long lasting, no fuss, looks natural, no need to rub it in like dry shampoos.~1300016.0

You can definitely try these colours it's quite affordable. Though it has a lot of shimmer which falls off even if you don't touch it, gets onto the clothes and body. Colours don't show up very strongly. You have to apply carefully.~

I searched for it here and other places online to no avail. I bought the Blue Velvet instead. It is a good quality product and does not make hair rough after application despite being a spray. The concept of the product is very innovative and nice as most people want a temporary change for like a party or something. However on keeping the bottle for over a month, the spray mechanism broke down and would not work. So that was a waste. Quantity is less than expected and will probably only suffice for a usage of 1-2 times as spraying 3-4 times on the same area is required if a long lasting effect is wanted. For the price it is good. I'm glad to see Blush Pink is now out. All-in-all, it is a Must Try product!!~

When I applied on my hairs, color is dark blue which is nice but after 5-7 min when it dries the color changed (very light blue). And it faded after 30 mins and leaves mark on my clothes. And after 2 hours its invisible on hairs, no color nothing. Very disappointed. Not going to REPURCHASE.~

I had to cover it up and didn't know a better way than to colour it. I coloured my hair (fully)back to how it was before and my parents didn't suspect my mischief. I couldn't go to a parlour for both as they're expensive. I was on an extremely tight budget and this worked wonders. it has been months since I used this product and till now, it hasn't run. Thank you Garnier!~

Unlike other products available in the market which are extremely costly, Hair4Real provides value for money. Being shampoo based colour, it covers all the grey hair with a single application. There is no need to use any conditioner after its application because, hair turn shiny and lustrous when washed after 7 to 10 minutes.   I was so happy with its use that I recommended this product to my brother-in-law, a banker, who was fed up with other available brands that claim free from ammonia but actually have abundance of ammonia and other chemicals. Some people may be selling their products under the garb of herbal products, but actually most of these are not herbal at all. Full marks to Hair4Real for its effectiveness and good after use effects.~

Earlier for fun and later out of necessity. However it's been twice that I've tried henna to color hair. I didn't expect magic and I was warned that it may dry my already dry thick hair. I used this product the second time. I soaked the henna overnight with some beetroot and boiled coffee water. Next day kept it on for almost 3 hours and then washed it off. My hair felt smooth and shiny without any serum. I didn't feel the dull dryness which comes with hair color and though the color is more copper this time  ( first was very orange) and apparently the color will vary. I am happy with the color and the greys were covered. The color lasted about 4-5 weeks and I have the color basically for a touch up ( the hair grows 3/4 of an inch a month and the greys show) I am willing to get behind this every month as it feels like a nourishing treatment with hair color. Ordering it the second time now~

The hue that it provides is just awesome brown. Thanks Nykaa for the quick delivery. Nice packing too !~

At this price, I think I got an excellent product. I don't have to wait for 40-45 minutes for the product to color my hair. Just 5-10 minutes are enough. I find this so very convenient in my busy schedule. This was my third pack of hair color. I don't want any other hair color now. Only Revlon top speed.~1300042.0

I myself purchased this for my brother before his marriage recently, and after using it my brother had faced a very severe eye problem. Just after the Reception Day , we took him a Medical College and admitted him because he lost his vision . Because of the application of this Revlon product which is extremely harmful for skin and eyes, it mixes with blood cells causing blindness. My brother is struggling with Glaucoma because of this product. I strongly recommend all users never buy REVLON products, even our doctors also instructed us to spread this important information to everyone so that no one can face this kind of severe health problem in their lives , it really matters !!  Companies should be careful in making products and the distributors must aware of the kind of products they are selling.   Simply, non-recommended product . Poisonous and should be banned. It may kill human being.~1300032.0

The color mentioned on the box and the resultant color are no where near. I already have brown hair by birth and color i got after applying as per mentioned on the box after applying it are completely different. Infact, one point i thought it was a fake product. I waited for 2-3 days hoping the color would come into effect but it don't. For that matter, even while standing in the sun, it don't give me any color. Utterly Disappointed. Did not expect this from Loreal. Will not recommend to anyone who want to color their hair. Instead go for any other brand like Garnier or something else.~1300006.0

This particular shade is very pretty and covers greys very effectively. I usually use Plum in the same series, but that tends to bleed in the first few washes (apparently reddish shades run easily. Still my favourite, though) - I didn't have that problem with this colour. According to my hairstylist, leaving the dye on for longer than the prescribed 20 minutes also helps, and it worked (although my hair felt a tiny bit rougher than it usually does after using these dyes.)  The colour itself is a rather deep black under artificial light, with some dark-chocolate tints reflected under sunlight. It is a little bit unidimensional but doesn't look artificial. The coverage is excellent. I imagine it would be especially perfect for covering-up highlights or old colour.  The consistency is very convenient to work with - thick enough not to drip, creamy enough to work into hair easily. The smell during application is strong but not unpleasant, and clean-up is extremely easy if you follow their suggestion of applying cream around your hairline before you use the dyes. I like that you can just massage it in and don't have to struggle with a fiddly little brush.  The after-colour conditioner is a dream, and I usually continue to use it for subsequent washes. The smell tends to be a little bit strong for me. I've found that the combination of this conditioner + The Body Shop Rainforest Radiance detangling spray for coloured hair gives me the best texture and shine post-colouring, as well as a gentler smell.   Touch-ups will probably be required every three or four weeks, depending on your hair growth. I find that after a little over 3 weeks, the colour seems to dull slightly. 5 weeks (although I often do wait that long) may be pushing it.  Pros:  Easy application, easy clean-up. Good coverage. Great after-colour conditioner.  Cons: Slightly strange flowery-chemical smell immediately after wash, which wears off after a while. Needs touch-ups every 3 weeks to look its best. Not relevant for this particular shade, but good general info for the brand: Reddish shades may bleed in the first few washes.  Would I recommend it? Definitely.~1300006.0

The shade has a soft shimmer which makes the hair shine and I just love the royal jelly conditioner that comes along with the box.~1300006.0

So if you want a red/ mahogany shade this is the one to go to. I was using Schwarzkopf's warm mahogany which is more of a red shade and since I could not get that in India, I decided to go with this one. As my hair already had the red tinge this complemented the existing shade perfectly and I did not see the orange hue as many red based shades tend to over time. Only con is that as with most hair colors this washes out soon (very visible if you have grey hair). Go for this only if you want an actual chocolate shade and not dark brown. For shoulder length I used the whole pack.~1300006.0

I had applied a few amount from it since I have small hair and kept the remaining amount in a safe but when i tried to use it for the second time the mixture was blackened and even if i had applied the mixture and waited for 1 hour but it wouldn't work anymore. So its for one time use only because even after that if u try to store it, it looses it chemical property because of mixing with air and wouldn't work for the second time. So, in my opinion it's too costly for ONE time use only!!~1300006.0

I used Chocolate colour and I dont see any difference from my original hair colour (which is the darkest brown most common indian hair colour). I was atleast hoping that it would cover the 3-4 grey hairs I have, no it didnt. Also, I had a few highlights I wanted to get rid off, that also didnt get covered. So whats the use of applying! The only positive thing about this is, it gave a nice shine to my hair.P.S: I followed the exact instructions mentioned and in the past I have tried Black cherry colour brought from shop and it worked.~1300006.0

If you have a lot of greys I would not recommend this product to you. I have a little patch of greys in front and barely got 30-40% of coverage even after applying repeated coats on same area. The result was golden light brown (like henna color) compared to brown on rest of the hair.Other than that if you just want to experience different color then go for it. The color that comes out on natural (non grey) hair is pretty beautiful and quality is good. I do miss the applicator comb brush I get with loreal excellence colors which you will not get with this one. The applicator only contains one nozzle type cap. It's ammonia free so naturally expect less durability than ammonia based colors, but I still liked the over all outcome. If you dislike paying hefty coloring bills at salon then this product is a good choice for you, it will give you salon like finish.~1300006.0

Read the voucher thoroughly. I spent almost an hour figuring that out. Look for details on Google.As for the product itself, it covers greys perfectly; just make sure to apply to the greys 20 minutes longer than the non-greys. As much as you'd like to think you can apply this all by yourself, it simply won't be the best decision. Ask for help!! Your greys are not just in the front, it's also at the back of your head. Also at the end of your colouring-session, massage it to your scalp, it'll cover all roots.Some points to bear in mind:1. Don't colour your hair in confined spaces. The fumes can make you get headaches and also make you nauseous. Keep the windows open.2. Make sure to apply vaseline to the top of your ears if you don't want to stain them.3. Don't leave it on for too long. 5-15 minutes over the time mentioned on the leaflet is alright, but longer you leave the drier your hair gets.4. Condition. Condition. Condition your hair. IMPORTANT.5. Use a drop of oil after your hair wash to your semi-wet hair when it's almost drying. Gives your hair the softest feel.This particular shade works best for Light brown-haired people to cover greys. For  people who have DARKER BROWN/BLACK HAIR, please go with darkest brown and if you have the blackest hair, go with black.~1300006.0

But it may be because I used medium brown over hair that had earlier been dyed with dark brown casting creme gloss. Medium brown does not last unless you leave the dye in your hair for an hour or more before washing it off, although the recommended time according to the instructions inside the pack is 20 to 30 minutes. Otherwise, as is mentioned in the pack, medium brown coverage is about 50%, and is good if you want a salt and pepper look.~1300006.0

Used it again after 3 months. My opinion about the product is that it may be suitable for some people. This time I applied much less quantity (like 1/10th of the tube) as I have short hair.  It still causes allergy. After full application..... leaving it for up to 8 minutes will give desirable results. Color lasts up to 2 weeks.Maybe it is suitable for certain skin types or people who don't experience allergy. For me it's just OK-------------------------------- FIRST ORIGINAL REVIEW----------- (With 01 Star Rating)----------------------------------Really BAD product. I had INSTANT allergy with it. Sticks to skin if you leave it for more than 10-15 minutes. Fades away rather fast (compared to other cheaper alternatives).If your SKIN is sensitive to chemical color.....this is NOT FOR YOU. Don't even try.~1300041.0

Alcohol based spray, velvet-shine finish. Apply on hair, use hair dryer to dry else it will spread on other hair. After 30 sec drying, use comb once to unstick the colored hair. Easily cleans with regular shampoo. The pic i uploaded is just a quick test job. Overspray will lead to cheap colored look. The hair will feel rough.~1300051.0

Although, after some time, it fades into a light shade of blue color. It makes the hair rough and you would want to avoid touching. It has a pungent odour and could give a headache. A temporary hair color spray, could be used for trail. But, I am not using it again, I'd rather go for permanent. ;)~1300051.0

Handy product. Comes out well on hair. Makes hair look a little dry generally. If applied on slightly moist hair it does not look that dry and frizzy. Try not to comb or brush your hair after applying it. The colour comes off and fades gradually if hair is brushed too much. Down-side: the colour would have been in higher demand if the quantity was little more than whats being provided at the range of 300-350.Also,the picture attached, is in bright sunlight so looks like electric blue but its a darker blue and looks good especially if you are aiming for subtle highlighting and not brightly coloured hair.~1300051.0

The quantity of the product is very less not sufficient for medium layered hair. The instructions which come with the pack mentions  that the color should be applied in 10-15 mins and total duration should be 20-30 mins.

Cover your nose and mouth while mixing the powder. Leaving any bleach in hair for longer than 20 minutes can melt your hair!! My skin is very sensitive and it burns like an allergy if touches on scalp. I suggest applying it away from scalp & roots. I think this is a good product but at same price you can get a much bigger Streax developer bottle and blonder powder.~1300051.0

Thought of trying Revlon. I didn't find much difference between the two. It worked for me. Infact its cheaper than loreal and quality is the same. It gives black colour to your hair and not brown. However it is subtle black and doesn't give the black hair dye effect. Planning to continue with this one. It may not necessarily suit all hair types so buy at ur own discretion. Also if u have lot of grey hair this colour is the best as it lasts longer than normal brown colour since it is darker than brown.This review is for brown black 2N shade.~1300032.0

The Godrej color can be used multiple times, you can mix a small amount for one application and save the rest. That way, it will last you 2-3 months. On the other hand, this Revlon color is for ""Single Application"" only & you need to discard the unused color.As far the results are concerned, I really can't tell the difference."~1300032.0

A shade darker should have suited better to my Indian wheat (light brown) complexion. Hair feels frizzy and dry despite using the conditioner provided. I think Loreal is a better option with regards to the quality of the hair after use. Also, the application process was a pain with the Revlon Colorsilk Hair Colour since the applicator bottle nozzle was too thick to let the mixture pass smoothly. Overall feeling duh for using this product especially for an important function. bad luck!The only thing positive was the good smell that I experienced during the application.~1300032.0

Does this product give brown hair? Yes. Does it look like the one in the photo posted by the girl with the fake review? Hell no!!! This was my first experience with hair coloring and my hair was already copper brown naturally so I expected this color to show a lot on my hair as my hair was not like typical Indian black hair. But I was slightly disappointed because that didn't happen and it doesn't color evenly. Most of the greys didn't get covered. The color is clearly visible under light but only on some hair. It didn't have much of a change on the texture. My hair neither become rough nor extra smooth and shiny after colouring. Texture remained same as before. I didn't notice any excess hairfall. I will try it again and update my review with photos next time. In the meanwhile I suggest you to give it a try yourself.Its not bad.~1300001.0

One pack is enough for short hair (just above the shoulder). This shade however gives you a jet black colour. Heard of hair so dark it glint's blue?? Well this is kinda like that. Fairly easy to apply.(tried it for the first time). Bit disappointed with the colour though. Wish it had a stronger bluish tinge. But it hasn't damaged my hair very badly. Hair felt a little rough after washing it off, but then after conditioning my hair it was back to normal.~1300001.0

It is creamy in texture. Since it has darkest colour, so obviously it has huge chemicals & ammonia as it's ingredients. It covered my greys. Which I have few on my crown area. & gave nice shade to my dark brown hairs. No irritation or other skin/scalp reactions. Hairs were nourished. Gorgeous brunette colour derived on my hairs, after washing this color with shampoo. It is long lasting. Mine is lasting since 1 month. Suits all skin tone. Fair skin toned people like me, will love it surely. I conditioned my hair with Dove rejuvenated volume conditioner."~

I used peacock blue. If you have black hair you need to bleach your hair with 20 volume 6% developer and a bleach. The hair colour doesnt really last long as it is semi permanent. Avoid using straightener  and curling irons, or the colour may fade out even more soon.  I love the hair colour.~

Although, not my favourite brand, they are pretty good. I have some advice below;*Before using these dyes, you MUST bleach your hair (unless you are naturally blonde). They will not show at all on black/dark brown hair. Only use HAIR bleach and no other kind of bleach. *To get the desired colour shown on the packet, your hair must be as close to white/pale yellow as possible; I highly recommend getting the bleaching done professionally at a salon.*Greens, blues and purples will stain your hair green, and are incredibly difficult to remove.*reds and pinks are easier to remove.*these colours will fade quickly in the sun/with heat/hot water. It is also best to use shampoos without SLS. *this dye can be left on for hours, and will result in a brighter colour (DO NOT TRY THIS WITH BOX DYES!)*add a small amount of dye to your conditioner to keep the colour topped up.~

The shades near 500 or so give a lighter tone on Indian brown hair. The Indian hair color is somewhere around 3.0. so if u want to lighten it, move towards 6.0. The three shades I used are all beautiful. They don't lighten hair as is displayed on box but what  suits our skin, more lighter won't look so flattering,especially on matured faced. Praline was lightest and my favorite. Hair are not damaged and the colour stays long even with simple shampoos.~1300006.0

I used Matrix opticare black shampoo and conditioner. Used to take care of my coloured locks very well. This hair colour has a very good conditioner too. I have extremely sensitive skin so I was a bit skeptical about using hair colour. But it did not even break me out by an inch. Quite a good coloring kit for all the sensitive skin ladies, I believe. One of the best hair colouring kits available in the Indian market.~

My fingers constantly get stuck in my hair while shampooing and it is a nightmare to comb. I have colored my hair in the past several times. Never had this experience.

It is way better than an ordinary black shade. After I colored my hair I felt my hair had a beautiful shine and felt soft. I do not feel there is any risk of damaging your hair here as my experience was wonderful and I'm going to look forward to try other shades without the fear of damaging my hair and also without the fear of whether it will suit my dusky skin or not.

I could feel the difference after first usage itself. It not only conditions the hair but also imparts a natural reddish brown color. The pack also comes with gloves and a hair cap which is useful.

It contains all necessary ingredients so we dont need to add any more to it and since its a herbal product, there is no worry for any side effects. It gives good coverage and also good color which stays for at least a month. It helps reduces hair fall and also prevents hair breakage. Few things I would suggest is.. keep the hair mask for at least 3-4 hours and also just rinse of the mask with water and skip shampooing for that day alone which helps the color to stay on longer. Henna is a coolant to our body so If you feel like catching a cold, please reduce the time you keep the mask on your hair.~

The amazing part I liked in this product is the long lasting color term that it gives. I recommend this product along with the Schwarzkopf Essensity developer. Now get professional parlor hair coloring at home with this hair color and developer.~

Just go for Revlon Top Speed, ammonia free hair color. It is handy and mostly recommended for a time saving hair coloring experience. It not only covers your grey hair in just five to seven minutes, but also prevents your hair from damaging effects of ammonia because ammonia hair colors depletes hair proteins and moisture while coloring the hair. Color stays for considerable period of time. One good thing is that while applying it you will not have to go through harsh and unwanted smell like few others. So in my opinion this is the best available hair color for fast root touch ups and hiding greys too. A must-try hair color.~1300041.0
